# User’s will be able to create an account and open ‘packs’ that will give them random players from a league they chosen (BPL. La Liga, Series A, etc.)
# They will then have the ability to edit the player’s stats. I was kinda looking into making it as a ‘Ultimate Team’ kinda function. If the player doesn’t want that player, they will be able to delete them. There will also be a selection in the app where user’s can view all their players.
